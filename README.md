This is an Machine learning project built on the concepts of object detection and pose detection. As a competitive basketball player, I am always looking to improve my game and refine my craft. Furthermore, as a big fan of the NBA, I am always inspired by the professional players and the skill moves they are able to pull off. Therefore, I thorught it would be facinating to create an application that would be able to detect and comapare my gameplay to that of professional basketball players. However as a prelimineary step to this ultimate goal, I first needed to crate an application that would be able to complete both object detection and pose tracking in realtime.
