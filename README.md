This is a Machine learning project built on the concepts of object detection and pose detection. As a competitive basketball player, I am always looking to improve my game and refine my craft. Furthermore, as a big fan of the NBA, I am always inspired by the professional players and the skill moves they are able to pull off. Therefore, I thought it would be fascinating to create an application that would be able to detect and compare my gameplay to that of professional basketball players. However, as a preliminary step to this ultimate goal, I first needed to create an application that would be able to complete both object detection and pose tracking in real-time.

## Getting started
Get a copy of this project by simply running the git clone command.
> git clone https://github.com/NitpreetB/Object-Detection-and-Pose-Tracking.git
